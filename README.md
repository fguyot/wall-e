# Project wall e


## Description : 

This repository contain the project wall e including the 3D print file, Arduino code and Python code. My goal is to explore the computer vision for robot and because I am a big fan of wall-e here we are.

I used the incredible work of [@chillibasket](https://github.com/chillibasket/walle-replica) to build and setup the robot. To start the project you can have a look on his website that describe the process.
